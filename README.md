## Key Components

### Data Sources & Spatial Analysis
- **Multi-source integration**: INE census data, OpenStreetMap infrastructure, Barcelona Open Data
- **Network modeling**: Graph-based analysis using NetworkX and OSMnx
- **Geographic processing**: Geopandas and Shapely for spatial operations
- **Elevation modeling**: Terrain-aware routing with slope-adjusted calculations

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Genetic Algorithm**: Population-based optimization with tournament selection, greedy crossover, and configurable mutation rates. Validated against MILP solutions achieving near-optimal results (â‰¤1% gap)
- **Simulated Annealing**: Single-solution optimization with temperature-based search
- **Multi-objective approach**: Balances coverage, accessibility, and socioeconomic equity

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11+** (required for local installation)
- **Docker** (recommended for reproducible environments)

### Option 1: Docker Installation (Recommended)

The project includes a complete Docker setup for reproducible environments:

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd bss-station-optimization
```

2. **Build the Docker image:**
```bash
docker build -t stations_optim .
```

3. **Run the container:**
```bash
docker run -it \
  -v $(pwd)/:/home/ \
  --user $(id -u):$(id -g) \
  stations_optim:latest
```

**Docker Features:**
- Python 3.11-slim base image
- Pre-installed JupyterLab and IPython kernel
- All system dependencies included
- **Volume mounting**: The `-v $(pwd)/:/home/` flag mounts your current directory to `/home/` inside the container, ensuring:
  - All your code, data, and results persist between container runs
  - Changes made inside the container are immediately visible on your host machine
  - You can edit files on your host and see changes in the container (and vice versa)
  - Data processing results are saved to your local filesystem

### Option 2: VS Code Dev Container

For VS Code users, the project includes a `.devcontainer` configuration:

1. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
2. Open the project in VS Code
3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container"
4. VS Code will automatically build and start the container with:
   - Python extension
   - Jupyter extension
   - Pre-configured workspace settings



## Usage

The project is organized into four main pipelines. Each one has its own detailed documentation:

#### 1. **Input Dataset Creation** (`src/create_input_dataset/`)
Downloads, processes and saves multi-source data from INE, OSM, and OpenDataBarcelona:
- **Socioeconomic data**: Population by age/sex, education, unemployment, income, vehicle ownership
- **Public transport infrastructure**: Metro, tram, and bus entrances, stops and lines from OSM
- **Urban structure**: Bike lanes and Points of Interest categorized by user input
- **Topography**: Elevation data and slope calculations from OpenTopoData

ðŸ“– **For detailed usage**: See [`src/create_input_dataset/README.md`](src/create_input_dataset/README.md)

#### 2. **Node Attribute Assignment** (`src/assign_to_nodes/`)
Enrichment of the network nodes by spatially aggregating the data obtained in the first pipeline.
- **Buffer-based assignment**: configurable radius buffers around network nodes to define their spatial context.
- **Multi-layer integration**: Combines infrastructure, urbanism, and socioeconomic data
- **Attribute normalization**: Multiple normalization methods (minmax, log, boxcox, robust, zscore)

ðŸ“– **For detailed usage**: See [`src/assign_to_nodes/README.md`](src/assign_to_nodes/README.md)

#### 3. **Optimization Engine** (`src/optimization/`)
Metaheuristic algorithms based on the result of the second pipeline:
- **GA**: Selection, elitism, crossover, and mutation strategies
- **Elevation-aware routing**: Realistic travel times using slope-adjusted travel distances
- **Graph metrics integration**: Network analysis for BSS accessibility and inter-station proximity 
- **Experimental pipeline**: from GA hyperparameter tuning to scenario analysis.

ðŸ“– **For detailed usage**: See [`src/optimization/README.md`](src/optimization/README.md)

#### 4. **Results Exploration** (`src/results_exploration/`)
Analysis and visualization tools for optimization results:
- **Four-panel comparison maps**: Administrative divisions, income, infrastructure, and POIs
- **Interactive mapping**: Folium-based maps with multiple basemap options
- **Utility functions**: Grid-based analysis, node plotting, and radar charts

ðŸ“– **For detailed usage**: See [`src/results_exploration/README.md`](src/results_exploration/README.md)



### Notebooks

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks for demonstration and exploration, with step-by-step pipeline examples, interactive parameter tuning, and rich visualizations. 

The visualizations of the paper where generated in these notebooks.

## Output

The system generates:

- **Optimized station locations**
- **Spatial analysis results** including visualizations and different empircal metrics
- **Interactive maps** for exploration and presentation



## Barcelona Case Study

The framework has been extensively tested on Barcelona's Bicing system, demonstrating:

- **Real-world scale**: 18,700+ network nodes, 38,000+ edges covering 101 kmÂ²
- **Complex urban context**: 10 districts, 73 neighborhoods with marked socioeconomic contrasts
- **Topographic challenges**: Coastal flatlands to 450m mountain slopes requiring elevation-aware routing
- **Multi-modal integration**: 260+ km bike lanes, 8 metro lines, 6 tram lines, 100+ bus routes

The Barcelona implementation showcases the framework's ability to handle real-world complexity while maintaining computational efficiency and solution quality.
